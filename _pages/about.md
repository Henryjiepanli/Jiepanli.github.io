I am a Ph.D. student (2020 - now) at State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping and Remote Sensing (LIESMARS), Wuhan University. I received B.S. degree from School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2016. I'm now a member of EVA group, advised by Prof. Wei He.

1. 《Towards Complex Backgrounds: A Unified Difference-Aware Decoder for Binary Segmentation》
Introduction: The current decoders are designed for specific objects based on the common backbones as
the encoders, but cannot deal with complex backgrounds. Inspired by the way human eyes detect objects of interest, a new unified
dual-branch decoder paradigm named the difference-aware decoder is proposed in this paper to explore the difference between the
foreground and the background and separate the objects of interest in optical images.
Key words: Binary segmentation, salient object detection, camouflaged object detection, polyp segmentation,
mirror detection.

2. 《Building Extraction from Remote Sensing Images via an Uncertainty-Aware Network》
Introduction: Due to the varying scales and styles of buildings, conventional deep learning models always suffer from uncertain predictions and cannot accurately distinguish the complete footprints of the building from the complex distribution of ground objects, leading to a large degree of omission and commission. In this paper, we realize the importance of uncertain prediction and propose a novel and straightforward Uncertainty-Aware Network (UANet) to alleviate this problem.
Key words: Building extraction, remote sensing, uncertainty-aware.
