The current decoders are designed for specific objects based on the common backbones as the encoders, but cannot deal with complex backgrounds. Inspired by the way human eyes detect objects of interest, a new unified dual-branch decoder paradigm named the difference-aware decoder is proposed in this paper to explore the difference between the foreground and the background and separate the objects of interest in optical images.
